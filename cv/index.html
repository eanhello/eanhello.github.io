<p style="padding-left: 30px">Abstract: Fought for a cause in which many Quakers ostensibly believed and had previously risked a great deal for, the American Civil War was a time of great trial for American Quakers. Extending ongoing efforts to understand this complex period, the following essay considers John G. Whittier’s mid-war poem, "In War Time," and the peculiarity of its simultaneous appearance in the three, divided Quaker periodicals of the nineteenth century. Specifically, this article argues that Whittier’s poem renders more legible the dilemma Friends faced when attempting to position their peace principles in ethical relation to the mass suffering of the war. Reflecting, while also contributing to, a major transformation in American Quakerism, "In War Time" questioned the ethics of dissociative pacifism, exhorting Quakers to assist the Union war effort, if only in non- combatant roles, as nurses in hospitals and as teachers among the freedmen.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">Summary:Part of a panel on <em>Nature and Narrative</em>, my presentation explored the way significant moments  silence in <em>Moby-Dick</em> are part of Melville’s deep engagement with the history of Nantucket Quakerism and the Quaker’s particular practice of Silent Worship. Close reading moments whereto the silence of the natural world becomes legible through Quaker thought and practice around embodied quietude, I argued that the Quaker's particular theories of religious stillness invites us to reconsider the relationship between the body, community, religion and the natural environment in <em>Moby-Dick. </em></p>
